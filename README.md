# Claude Quick Start

A set of useful commands I have compiled from different sources to support myself on AI codigin workflows

### About

The commands prefixed with `zevi` are taken from `Zevi Arnovitz` PM AI workflow as described by him on Lenny's podcast [Lenny's Podcast](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/the-non-technical-pms-guide-to-building-with-cursor)

The commands prefixed with `hl` are taken from `Human Layer` [See Repo](https://github.com/humanlayer/humanlayer/tree/main/.claude/commands)
